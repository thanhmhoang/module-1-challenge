# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

This Study Guide was created for myself and fellow boot camp students who were going through the prework to organize and navigate through all the notes and information. It contains notes on the initial learnings and fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This tool helps as a students guide for students to refer back to as they go through the bootcamp. This project helped me learn how to build a web application using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
